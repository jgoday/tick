# 0.5

* tick.core is the main api ns now. tick.alpha.api has been removed

* interval functions in tick.alpha.api have moved to tick.alpha.interval
* calendar and ical namespaces have also moved to tick.alpha 

* +/- functions now only work on periods or durations. Use >>/<< to move a date by an amount

This is so args to +/-  are associative, commutative etc, same as clojure.core +/-

* parse function has moved out of the main api. 

See tick.protocols/IParseable docstrings for more info
