= tick

A Clojure(Script) library for dealing with time. Intended as a
replacement for clj-time.

Based on Java 8 time (on the JVM) and js-joda (on JavaScript
runtimes). We are considering an implementation based on https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal[Temporal], via
https://github.com/henryw374/tempo[Tempo] when it is available.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[tick.core :as t])

;; Get the current time
(t/now)
----

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFuL-ZDoB2U[Henry Widd's talk at Clojure/North 2019] for some background

== Docs

http://juxt.pro/tick/docs/index.html[Tick Documentation]

== Status

* tick.core - stable
* tick.alpha.interval - Alpha: Ready to use with the caveat that the API might still undergo
minor changes.

== Install

Get the latest from https://clojars.org/tick[Clojars] and
add to your `project.clj`, `build.boot` or `deps.edn`.

Tick versions 0.4.24-alpha and up require minimum Clojurescript version of 1.10.741

For Clojurescript users of Tick, see https://github.com/juxt/tick/blob/master/docs/cljs.adoc[docs/cljs.adoc], for
some discussion around Clojurescript build size.

Here is a one-liner to drop into a node repl with tick:

----
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.741" } tick/tick {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} }}' -m cljs.main  -re node  --repl
----

== Development

image:https://circleci.com/gh/juxt/tick/tree/master.svg?style=svg["CircleCI", link="https://circleci.com/gh/juxt/tick/tree/master"]

=== Develop The Documentation Site

Build the html
----
make
----

Build the CLJS and start a figwheel repl+server
----
make dev-docs-cljs
----

Navigate to localhost:9500 in your browser

=== Build a production version of the Documentation Site

----
make release-docs-cljs
----

=== Develop Tick

Jack in with cider or equivalent method in other IDEs, and start the cljs build with:

----
(figwheel-start!)
----


And when you get a REPL you can run all the JVM tests with

----
(test-clj)
----

Or outside of the REPL run:

----
make test-all
----

which will run clojure, clojurescript (node) and clojurescript (chrome) tests.
JVM tests are currently running with https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[Kaocha] while JS tests are using figwheel-main and the cljs-test-runner.

As long as you have you have started your repl with these aliases "-A:dev:test-clj", you can also run backend clojure tests in the repl with something like

----
(require '[kaocha.repl :as kr])
(kr/run :clj)
----

=== npm dependencies

For running the ClojureScript tests you will need the following npm dependencies installed:

----
sudo npm install -g karma-cli
sudo npm install -g karma
sudo npm install -g karma-chrome-launcher
sudo npm install -g karma-cljs-test
----

Check `.circleci/config.yml` for the versions that are known to work.

==== Setting `CHROME_BIN`

If you get an error similar to the following:

----
No binary for ChromeHeadless browser on your platform.
----

Set the environment variable `CHROME_BIN` to wherever Chrome or Chromium is installed on your platform.


=== Release

create a git tag.

`make install VERSION=your-tag` (this installs in ~/.m2 - check that things look ok)

`make deploy VERSION=your-tag`  - you need to have set up clojars credentials as per https://github.com/applied-science/deps-library

`git push origin new-tag-name`

== Acknowledgements

In particular, special credit to Eric Evans for discovering Allen's
interval algebra and pointing out its potential usefulness,
demonstrating a working implementation of Allen's ideas in
link:https://github.com/domainlanguage/time-count[his Clojure library].

Thanks also to my esteemed colleagues Patrik Kårlin for his redesign of
the interval constructor function, and Henry Widd for porting to cljc.
