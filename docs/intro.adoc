Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.

_Tick_ is a comprehensive Clojure(Script) library designed to make it
easier to write programs that involve time and date calculations:

* Functions to manipulating time, easily and succinctly (stable)
* Powerful functions for slicing and dicing time intervals (stable)
* Implementation of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_interval_algebra[Allen's interval algebra] (alpha)
* Support for iCalendar serialization (work-in-progress)

In many business domains, dates are as fundamental as numbers and
strings. It's often desirable to have date-heavy business logic
portable across platforms. _Tick_ supports both Clojure and
ClojureScript, with an identical API.

Tick is implemented using https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time[(a very thin wrapper over) the api of `java.time`] and an understanding of the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/overview.html[concepts behind java.time] 
will be very useful when working with tick, 
because tick entities are java.time entities (Instant, LocalTime etc). Where tick doesn't provide the api you need,
you can look at the java.time api to see if there alternatives. If you cannot find the help you need in the tick documentation, it 
is quite likely that someone will have had the same query and had it resolved on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java-time[Stack Overflow].

== Status

_tick.core_ (the main API)is stable. The namespaces under tick.alpha.*, such as tick.alpha.interval are _alpha_ status. 
By _alpha_, we mean that the
library's API may change in future. Do let us know if you come across
any unexpected behaviour or bugs anywhere in _tick_.

== Comparison to other time libraries

=== Java 8 time

Java 8's link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html[`java.time`] API is both influenced by, and an improvement on,
Joda Time.

Unlike older JDK dates and calendars, instances in
`java.time` are immutable so can be considered values in Clojure. For this reason, there is no reason to wrap these values. Consequently, there is full interoperability between _tick_ and `java.time`. Where _tick_ does not provide a part of java.time's functionality, 
`java.time` can be called https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time[directly] in either Clojure or Clojurescript.

CAUTION: Because _tick_ is built on `java.time`, Clojure programs must run on Java 8 or higher.

=== clj-time and cljs-time

Most Clojure applications use `clj-time` which is based on Joda
Time. However, `cljs-time` objects are mutable goog.date objects which in turn wrap
 JavaScript Date objects.

This works OK as a proxy for Instant, but is not a great foundation
for local dates etc.

The author of cljs-time, Andrew McVeigh, has said he would ideally
move `cljs-time` off `goog.date` but is unlikely to do so at this
point. For one thing, there could be more than a few current users
relying on the JS Date nature of the cljs-time objects.

Taking a fresh look at the date/time landscape, we now have java.time (JSR-310)
and implementations in both Java and Javascript and so it is possible
to create _tick_, which combines the excellent JSR-310 with an
expressive, cross-platform Clojure(Script) API.

For some use cases it is possible to write cross-platform code with clj/s-time, conditionally requiring clj-time 
or cljs-time in a cljc file. In our experience though, the fact that cljs-time doesn't have complete fidelity
with clj-time often comes to be a problem.
