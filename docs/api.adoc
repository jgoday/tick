= API

_Tick_ provides the `tick.core` namespace, containing the functions that make up the library's stable API.

When you are using _tick_ in programs, it is a recommended idiom that you require _tick_'s api under the `t` alias as follows:

----
(require '[tick.core :as t])
----

CAUTION: Try to restrict your use of _tick_ to the `tick.core` namespace and tick.alpha.* namespaces. 
Functions in other namespaces, which may not be marked private, are not part of the official API and could change.
