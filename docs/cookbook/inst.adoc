== Instants and Inst

tick's default convention is `java.time.Instant` but caters for projects that use
`java.util.Date` by the conversions above. It is recommended when using tick to
keep as an instant for as long as possible.

=== Creation

====
To get the current instant:

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/instant)
----

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/now)
----
====

====
Create a specific instant:

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/instant "2000-01-01T00:00:00.001Z")
----
====

=== Conversions between Inst and Instant

====
Convert inst to and from instant:

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/instant (t/inst))
----

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/inst (t/instant))
----
